# Customer Segmentation Analysis 

## Project Overview

This project aims to perform customer segmentation analysis for an e-commerce company by analyzing customer behavior and purchase patterns. The goal is to group customers into distinct segments to enable more targeted marketing strategies, improve customer satisfaction, and enhance overall business strategies.

## Dataset

The dataset contains customer information, purchase history, and various demographic details that help in identifying patterns in customer behavior. [Include dataset source or link if applicable].

## Key Steps

1. **Data Collection**: Loading and exploring the customer data, ensuring all relevant columns (e.g., purchase history, customer demographics) are properly understood.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and addressing outliers to ensure data quality.
3. **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculating key metrics such as average purchase value, frequency of purchases, and total spending for a better understanding of customer patterns.
4. **Outlier Detection**: Visualizing the data using box plots before and after removing outliers to improve the clustering results.
5. **Customer Segmentation**: Using the K-means clustering algorithm to segment customers into groups based on their spending habits and demographics.
6. **Data Visualization**: Creating visualizations such as scatter plots, bar charts, and cluster plots to illustrate the characteristics of each customer segment.
7. **Insights and Recommendations**: Analyzing the results from clustering to provide actionable insights and recommendations.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- **Python**: Main programming language for data analysis and modeling.
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas` – Data manipulation and cleaning.
  - `matplotlib` & `seaborn` – Data visualization.
  - `scikit-learn` – Clustering (K-means algorithm).
  - `warnings` – For suppressing unnecessary warnings.
  
## Insights and Recommendations

### Cluster 0 (Low-income, Moderate Family Size, Low Engagement)
- **Income**: ~$45,867.
- **Spending**: Low average total spending (~$245).
- **Engagement**: Low response to promotions.
- **Recommendation**: Offer discounts on essential products like meat and wine to boost engagement.

### Cluster 1 (Lower-income, Large Families, Low Spending on Premium Products)
- **Income**: ~$32,886.
- **Spending**: Lowest average total spending (~$113).
- **Recommendation**: Provide family-oriented product bundles at discounted prices.

### Cluster 2 (High-income, Low Family Size, High Spending on Premium Products)
- **Income**: ~$72,730.
- **Spending**: High average total spending (~$1,184).
- **Recommendation**: Target high-income customers with exclusive offers on premium products.

### Cluster 3 (High-income, Moderate Family Size, High Engagement)
- **Income**: ~$71,950.
- **Spending**: High average total spending (~$1,164).
- **Recommendation**: Strengthen loyalty programs to further engage high spenders.

## Conclusion

This analysis helps the e-commerce company identify distinct customer segments and develop targeted marketing strategies. Implementing these strategies based on the insights provided can increase customer satisfaction, boost spending, and improve customer retention.

## Future Work

- Explore additional clustering techniques (e.g., hierarchical clustering) for comparison.
- Implement real-time segmentation for dynamic customer analysis.
